## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to U.S. public opinions on climate change and how they have changed over time. I also hope to find a data set that takes into account how the sources that people receive their news from can impact their opinions on if climate change is real, and further, the degree of action that should be taken in addressing this existential crisis. Another idea I am contemplating is patterns of racial discrimination in the utilization of school resource officers in school districts across the United States.
